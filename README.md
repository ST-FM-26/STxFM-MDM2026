# Workshop on Spatio-Temoral Data and Foundation Models @MDM'26 ([STxFM](https://st-fm-26.github.io/STxFM-MDM2026/))

## Workshop Objectives
As urban environments worldwide become increasingly interconnected and data-rich, it is crucial to explore the implications of integrating advanced artificial intelligence with complex physical-world data. This workshop aims to delve into the profound influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), and more generally, foundations models, the structure and dynamics of the spatio-temporal ecosystem. Specifically, we aim to foster research on the interplay between foundation models and critical urban elements, including points of interest (POIs), human mobility flows and trajectories, road network structures, and urban regions. By bringing together experts from natural language processing (NLP), data mining, and spatio-temporal database
management, the workshop provides a platform to discuss ideas, review past work, and explore new directions. The focus is on the synergy between foundation models and spatio-temporal data from two primary aspects:

• Foundation models-empowered Spatio-Temporal Engineering. Exploring how LLMs can empower tasks such as trajectory data cleansing, relation inference between spatial entities, and natural language interfaces for geographic query processing.

• Spatio-Temporal Data-enhanced LLMs. Examining how structured spatial knowledge and mobility data can enhance LLMs through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-modal data management to address issues like hallucination and spatial reasoning.

By including participants from both academia and industry, the workshop aims to connect practical urban applications with cutting-edge research, encouraging collaborations that will shape the future of intelligent spatio-temporal systems and their impact on societal well-being.
