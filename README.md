# Knowledge and Data Engineering Meets Large Language Models: Challenges and Opportunities Workshop @ICDE'26 ([KDExLLM](https://kde-meets-llm.github.io/KDExLLM-ICDE2026/))

## Workshop Objectives
This workshop on the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge and Data Engineering is a pioneering event at top-tier conferences. It brings together experts to share recent challenges and opportunities, aiming to inspire future research. With oral presentations and poster sessions, the workshop will provide a platform for researchers from natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and database management to discuss ideas, review past work, and explore new directions. The focus is on the synergy between LLMs and knowledge and data engineering from two aspects. The first explores how LLMs empower knowledge base and database management tasks, such as data cleansing, relation inference, and query processing. The second examines how knowledge bases and database systems enhance LLMs, through retrieval-augmented generation, multi-modal data management, and more. By including participants from academia and industry, the workshop aims to connect practical applications with research, encouraging collaboration that will shape the future of intelligent knowledge base and database systems.

## Workshop Topics and Themes
The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of knowledge base and database management, creating new opportunities as well as challenges. LLMs are opening up novel pathways for core knowledge base and database tasks, including data cleansing, schema and relation inference, knob tuning, and query processing, while knowledge bases and database systems are increasingly being leveraged to enhance LLM reliability, mitigate hallucination, and improve data governance and privacy. Despite growing interest and early successes in both LLM-empowered knowledge base/database systems and knowledge base/database-enhanced LLMs, this research area remains at an early and dynamic stage. We invite submissions that explore the synergy, integration, and co-evolution of knowledge bases, database systems, and LLMs, and that provide insights, solutions, or emerging applications from academic and industrial perspectives.
