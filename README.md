# Workshop on Spatio-Temoral Data and Foundation Models @MDM'26 ([STxFM](https://st-fm-26.github.io/STxFM-MDM2026/))

## Workshop Objectives
As urban environments worldwide become increasingly interconnected and data-rich, it is crucial to explore the implications of integrating advanced artificial intelligence with complex physical-world data. This workshop aims to delve into the profound influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), and more generally, foundations models, the structure and dynamics of the spatio-temporal ecosystem. Specifically, we aim to foster research on the interplay between foundation models and critical urban elements, including points of interest (POIs), human mobility flows and trajectories, road network structures, and urban regions. By bringing together experts from natural language processing (NLP), data mining, and spatio-temporal database
management, the workshop provides a platform to discuss ideas, review past work, and explore new directions. The focus is on the synergy between foundation models and spatiotemporal data from two primary aspects:
• Foundation models-empowered Spatio-Temporal Engineering. Exploring how LLMs can empower tasks such as trajectory data cleansing, relation inference between spatial entities, and natural language interfaces for geographic query processing.
• Spatio-Temporal Data-enhanced LLMs. Examining how structured spatial knowledge and mobility data can enhance LLMs through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-modal data management to address issues like hallucination and spatial reasoning.
By including participants from both academia and industry, the workshop aims to connect practical urban applications with cutting-edge research, encouraging collaborations that will shape the future of intelligent spatio-temporal systems and their impact on societal well-being.

## Workshop Topics and Themes
The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of knowledge base and database management, creating new opportunities as well as challenges. LLMs are opening up novel pathways for core knowledge base and database tasks, including data cleansing, schema and relation inference, knob tuning, and query processing, while knowledge bases and database systems are increasingly being leveraged to enhance LLM reliability, mitigate hallucination, and improve data governance and privacy. Despite growing interest and early successes in both LLM-empowered knowledge base/database systems and knowledge base/database-enhanced LLMs, this research area remains at an early and dynamic stage. We invite submissions that explore the synergy, integration, and co-evolution of knowledge bases, database systems, and LLMs, and that provide insights, solutions, or emerging applications from academic and industrial perspectives.
